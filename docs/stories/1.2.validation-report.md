# Validation Report for Story 1.2: Core Monitoring Service Implementation

**Date:** 2025-12-03
**Validator:** Product Owner (Sarah)
**Status:** **GO** (Pending Minor Fixes)

## 1. Template Compliance Issues
*   **Missing Section**: The `Change Log` section is missing. This is required by the `story-template-v2`.
*   **Missing Subsection**: The `Dev Notes` section is missing the `Testing` subsection. While testing tasks are present, the specific standards (Jasmine/Karma) should be explicitly listed here as per the template.

## 2. Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*   *None identified.* The story aligns well with the architectural documentation (`docs/rescrita-tecnica-angular.md`) and the Epic requirements.

## 3. Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)
*   **Testing Standards**: Add the `Testing` subsection to `Dev Notes`. Explicitly state usage of Jasmine and Karma, and `HttpTestingController` for mocking, as defined in the project standards.
*   **Change Log**: Add an empty `Change Log` table to track future modifications.

## 4. Nice-to-Have Improvements
*   **CORS Context**: While `HttpClient` works natively in Capacitor/Electron, developers might face CORS issues during `ionic serve` (browser dev). A note in `Dev Notes` about this (e.g., "Use proxy.conf.json if needed for browser dev, or rely on Capacitor native handling") would be helpful context.

## 5. Anti-Hallucination Verification
*   **Verified**: `MonitorService` requirements (Singleton, `HttpClient`, `BehaviorSubject`, RxJS `timer`) strictly follow `docs/rescrita-tecnica-angular.md`.
*   **Verified**: `PingResult` interface matches the architecture definition.
*   **Verified**: No prohibited libraries (Axios/Fetch) were suggested.

## Final Assessment
**Implementation Readiness Score**: 9/10
**Confidence Level**: High

The story is technically sound and actionable. Once the `Change Log` and `Testing` standards sections are added to align with the template, it is ready for the Development Agent.
